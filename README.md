# Mimisbrunnur
For some years now I've been considering joining the 21'st century and get an e-reader. One day when I was sorting through some old junk at my family home, I came across this presentation case (from the early 80's I think) that used to hold a Parker ball point pen and a small calculator. With the pen lost and the calculator broken, I was about to toss it when a thought struck me; this would make a rather nice case for an e-reader. Thus was Mimisbrunnur born.

Needless to say, this is a very back-to-front approach to any project. A reasonable person, well, a reasonable person would just have bought any of the number of commercial offerings out there. That would have brought a slick and polished user interface, and with a bit of forethought wouldn't have locked one into any particular ecosystem.

A slightly less reasonable person would have considered system requirements, existing software and best hardware choices, with the actual case probably being the last item on the list.

And then there is me. Actually I did give a cursory glance at the above, but I was rather besotted with that case. Anyway, I don't expect anyone will mimic this project in every detail (the case is not an off-the-shelf item today, that I know of), but I hope some parts of it may be of some use to others.

I bought most of the parts for this from Adafruit. Product links are provided in the text. I have no affiliation with them except as a satisfied customer. Particularly nice is the level of documentation and support they provide for their products.

The name Mímisbrunnur comes from the old norse mythology Ásatrú. It is a well or fount of wisdom located at the roots of the world tree Yggdrasill. An e-reader can be considered, if not a fount then a vessel of knowledge.
