It may sound ass-forwards to provide instructions for something that there only exists one example of, and that in a constant flux of development, but I think they can provide a sense of what the reader is and how it works, and thereby whether anyone would want to dive down the rabbit hole and make something similar.

## Physical components
Physically, the user interface consists of:

1: An e-paper display

2: A set of eight push buttons

3: Two indicator lights

4: A reading light

5: A micro-SD slot/card to hold files

6: A USB-C connector for charging and programming

The display has a status bar at the top, providing information about battery voltage, free memory and the main contents of the display, the last mentioned dependent on what is being displayed.

At the bottom is a menu corresponding to the buttons and indicating the function of each one. Each menu item can show an icon, which function is accessed by a short press of the corresponding button. Each menu item can also show a number referemce, that is accessed by holding the corresponding button for approx. two seconds.

The two indicators are an amber charge indicator and a red busy indicator, both located near the USB connector. When the busy indicator is lit or flashing the buttons will not work, and the SD card may be in use and should not be removed.
