It may sound ass-forwards to provide instruction for something that there only exists one example of, and that in a constant flux of development, but I think they can provide a sense of what the reader is and how it works, and thereby whether anyone would want to dive down the rabbit hole and make something similar.

## Physical components
Physically, the reader consists of:

1: An e-paper display

2: A set of eight push buttons

3: A reading light

4: Two indicator lights

5: A midro-SD slot/card to hold files

6: A USB-C connector for charging and programming
